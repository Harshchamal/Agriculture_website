This project is a dynamic and informative agriculture website developed to support the mission of the Department of Agriculture (DOA) in Sri Lanka. It showcases how modern web technologies can be used to promote sustainable farming, ecological practices, and food security awareness across various regions.

Built using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the website provides a clean and responsive user interface, ensuring accessibility on all devices. The development was carried out using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for efficient coding, debugging, and version control integration.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Informational Pages: Highlights the role of DOA and introduces ecological farming concepts.

Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly layout using modern CSS.

Dynamic Elements: JavaScript is used for user interaction and basic animations.

Backend Integration: PHP is used to manage dynamic content and backend processes.

The goal of this project is to provide usersâ€”especially local farmers and agriculture enthusiastsâ€”with easy access to up-to-date agricultural practices that are both environmentally friendly and effective. By emphasizing eco-farming, the website promotes the reduction of chemical use, supports biodiversity, and encourages the preservation of soil and water quality.

This project reflects the real-world application of full-stack development using simple but powerful tools, making it a great learning resource for beginners and an effective platform for public agricultural outreach.
